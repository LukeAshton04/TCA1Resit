        <h2>Modual Report</h2>
        <h3>Modual Experiance</h3>
        <p>I think that this modual was well delivered and helped me to gain a better understanding of HTML and CSS.
        One thing that I would improve about this modual is making the friday online lessons accessable as a recording as I was unable to attend most of these sessions,
        and when I could attend I found them very useful.
        In future I will also need to have better time managment as becuase I missed the online lectures I did not get all of the code to  complete the tasks for the lessons which would have helped me complete the work.
        Finally I stuggled to image items of previous work as I have not completed any work yet myself.

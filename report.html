       <h1>Reflection of modual experiance</h1>

       <p>In this section I will go over my experiance with this modual as well as what I have learnt and
        the challanges that I have faced.</p>

        <H2>How did the project go?</H2>

        <p>I found this project very difficult as I felt that I lacked direction as it was mainly a trask about what I wanted to produce with little direction.
            I also struggled using GitHub as I had never used it before and found it difficult to use.

            Additionally I struggled to make effective use of dev tools as I found that when I made changes it would impact other parts of the code that I had not intended to change.

            Finally I was unable to make the deadline and struggled to put projects that I have done so instead of leaving the pages blank I have put in placeholder text.
        </p>

        <h2>How did I test my code?</h2>
        
        <p>When testing my code I made use of the W3C validator tool to make sure that all of my code was valid and did not have any errors.I 
            also made use of dev tools and the console to make sure that my code was working as intended. I took screenshots of my code and made sure that it was working as intended.
            Finally I made use of branches and commits so that If I did make a mistake in my code I could go back to a previous version of my code.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
       
        <p>I took inspiration from the university website with my colouring and had a Black bacground for the index page.
            I also made use of my classroom solutions to help me with my code and to help me with my design.
            I made the code as colourfull as possible to make it clear that I had the functionality in place easily visible for things such as the animations.
            Finally as an improvement I used google fonts to change the font of my website to make it more visually appealing.
        </p>

        <h2>What would I do differently?</h2>
        
        <p>If I was to redo this modual I would make sure that I had a clear vision of what I wanted to produce from the start and would have made sure to make use of the resources that were available to me.
        I would have attened the support sessions with questions and would try to make a frendship group which I could ask for help if I needed </p>

        <h2>Validation Screenshots</h2>
        <img src="Test.png" alt="Validation screenshot showing mobile optimization issues">
        <p>As you can see from this screen shot I struggled with the mobile optimisation and had multiple hamburger-icons. I managed to fix this issue however was unable to get the closing of the icon and the menu to work.</p>
